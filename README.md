<p>You might be probably wondering why is there a sloth bear on the screen?" But no. I mean, how can you think that way? How can a bear sit on your screen? You are just looking at a name and a picture of one. You might even wonder how on any planet this works? My dear friend, it is so simple. It works "almost" the same way as Firefox does - it has nothing to do with fire or a fox.</p>

<p>But, hey, come on. Let me really tell you about why you are here. You are here to experience a masterpiece in making.</p> 

<p><b>Elugubanti</b> is a light-weight browser written in Python. She renders only text from a webpage ignoring all CSS, fancy JavaScript, pictures, videos and basically all visual elements.</p>

<p>Elugubanti is still in development. She is just a few days old. Who knows what she will grow into?</p>  
<h2>Here are a few things you can make Elugubanti do for now:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Start a browsing session by running the script "browser.py".</li>
<li> Fetch a web page and display it by typing in a url.</li>
<li> Navigate through open tabs using a "switch tabs" command.</li>
<li> Traverse through the browsing history using a "back" command.</li>
<li> Fetch a Wikipedia summary of a query (A query must not resemble a url).</li>
<li> Close the browser using an "exit" command.</li>
</ul>
