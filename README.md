<h1>Meet Freddie!</h1>
<p><b>Freddie</b>, named after <b>Freddie Mercury</b>, is a light-weight browser written in Python, that renders only text from a webpage ignoring all CSS, fancy JavaScript, pictures, videos and basically all visual elements.</p>
<p>The currently not-so-good GUI is built using Python's Tkinter module.
<p>Freddie is still in development.</p>  
<h2>Here are a few things you can make Freddie do for now:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Open the browser by running the script "main.py".</li>
<li> Fetch a web page and display it by typing in a url.</li>
</ul>
