<h1>Meet Freddie!</h1>
<p><b>Freddie</b> is a light-weight browser written in Python. She renders only text from a webpage ignoring all CSS, fancy JavaScript, pictures, videos and basically all visual elements.</p>

<p>Freddie is still in development.</p>  
<h2>Here are a few things you can make Freddie do for now:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Start a browsing session by running the script "freddie.py".</li>
<li> Fetch a web page and display it by typing in a url.</li>
<li> Navigate through open tabs using a "switch tabs" command.</li>
<li> Traverse through the browsing history using a "back" command.</li>
<li> Fetch a Wikipedia summary of a query (A query must not resemble a url).</li>
<li> Close the browser using an "exit" command.</li>
</ul>
